        The pyarrow table data
    schema: pyarrow Schema
        The wanted schema to cast to the table data.
        All columns in pyarrow table must be present in the schema.

    Will reorder and set the schema you want to fit the in-use schema.
    The column names in the in use schema must be present in the wanted schema.
    They should preferably have the same datatype, but not necessarily
    the same datatype settings, especially when it comes to DictionaryType.
    If datatypes are different, the wanted schema is used. And if DictionaryType
    is present in that case, you must then change your datatypes before casting
    this new schema.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    inuse_schema:
        The schema that is in use of your pyarrow dataset or table.
    wanted_schema:
        The schema that you want, but it is not in the same order of
        the schema that is in use.
    
    Returns:
    A new pyarrow schema that has the same order as the in use schema,
    but with the correct datatypes from the schema that we want.
